\title{
Predict Method for addreg Fits
}
\description{
Obtains predictions from a fitted \code{\link{addreg}} object.
}
\usage{
\method{predict}{addreg}(object, newdata = NULL, type = c("link", "response", "terms"), terms = NULL, 
        na.action = na.pass, checkminmax = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
  \item{object}{
	a fitted object of class inheriting from \code{"addreg"}.
}
  \item{newdata}{
	optionally, a data frame in which to look for variables with which to predict.
	If omitted, the fitted linear predictors are used.
}
  \item{type}{
	the type of prediction required. The default is on the scale of the linear predictors; 
	the alternative \code{"response"} is on the scale of the response variable. 
	The \code{"terms"} option returns a matrix giving the fitted values of each term in the 
	model formula on the linear predictor scale.

	The value of this argument can be abbreviated.
}
  \item{terms}{
	with \code{type = "terms"} by default all terms are returned. 
	A character vector specifies which terms are to be returned.
}
  \item{na.action}{
	function determining what should be done with missing values in \code{newdata}. 
	The default is to predict \code{NA}.
}
  \item{checkminmax}{
	logical indicating whether or not values of continuous covariates in \code{newdata} 
	should be checked to ensure they lie within the covariate space associated with the 
	fitted model. Otherwise predicted values could lie outside the 
	parameter space.
}
  \item{\dots}{
	further arguments passed to or from other methods.
}
}
\details{
If \code{newdata} is omitted the predictions are based on the data used for the fit. 
In that case how cases with missing values in the original fit are treated is determined by the 
\code{na.action} argument of that fit. If \code{na.action = na.omit}, omitted cases 
will not appear in the residuals; if \code{na.action = na.exclude} they will 
appear, with residual value \code{NA}. See also \code{\link{napredict}}.
}
\value{
A vector or matrix of predictions. For \code{type = "terms"}, this is a matrix with
a column per term, and may have an attribute \code{"constant"}.

\note{
Variables are first looked for in \code{newdata} and then searched for in the usual 
way (which will include the environment of the formula used in the fit). A warning 
will be given if the variables found are not of the same length as those in 
\code{newdata} if it was supplied.
